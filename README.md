## Computational Intelligence of Electric Vehicles Charging Efficiency Using Hybrid AI Methods
### Instructions for how to run the Code
[Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valakhorasani/electric-vehicle-charging-patterns)

The code was written using Jupyter Notebook, and can be run there or in Google CoLab. 

When running it in Jupyter Torch needs to be installed, since we use PyTorch. 

The code runs fine in Google CoLab, but there is possibly a need to add and run `!pip install scikit-fuzzy` in a code block above the imports/first code block to make it run properly.\
You also need to remember to upload the Dataset to Google CoLab, with the name “ev_charging_patterns.csv”
